HTTP Methods: RESTful APIs leverage standard HTTP methods to indicate actions on resources. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the most common:

GET: Retrieves data from the server (e.g., getting a list of books, fetching a single book by ID).
POST: Creates a new resource on the server (e.g., adding a new book to the catalog).
PUT: Updates an existing resource on the server (e.g., editing a book‚Äôs information).
DELETE: Removes a resource from the server (e.g., deleting a book).
Status codes: The server returns HTTP status codes to convey the outcome of an API request. Understanding these codes helps you test successfully:

2xx Success: Indicates successful actions (e.g., 200 OK for a successful GET, 201 Created after a successful POST).
4xx Client Error: Signals an issue likely related to the request itself (e.g., 400 Bad Request for invalid data, 404 Not Found if a resource doesn‚Äôt exist).
5xx Server Error: Points to problems on the server side (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error).
Validation: A crucial aspect of API testing is ensuring responses from the server are valid and meet expectations. This involves:

Structure: Verify that the response adheres to the expected format, typically JSON for RESTful APIs.
Content-Type: Confirm that the Content-Type header correctly specifies the format of the response (e.g., application/json).
Data Integrity: Check that the data within the response matches your expectations, both in terms of values and their types.

Beyond the Basics
Error Handling: Include tests that deliberately trigger error scenarios (e.g., invalid input, missing resources) and ensure your API responds with appropriate error codes and messages.
Parameterization: Use PyTest‚Äôs parameterization feature to efficiently test multiple input variations within a single test function.

## üîπ Stage 1: Fundamentals (Beginner)

**What to Learn**

* What is an API? Types: REST, SOAP, GraphQL, gRPC.

REST (Representational State Transfer):
REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications.
It operates over HTTP and uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources, which are identified by URLs.
REST APIs are stateless, meaning each request from a client to the server contains all the information needed to understand the request.
They typically exchange data in formats like JSON or XML.

GraphQL:
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a type system defined for your data. 
It allows clients to request exactly the data they need, preventing over-fetching or under-fetching of data.
GraphQL APIs typically expose a single endpoint, and clients send queries to retrieve specific data, mutations to modify data, and subscriptions for real-time updates.

* Key concepts: Request/Response, Endpoints, Resources, Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH).

Perfect place to start üëç Let me break down these **key API concepts** in a clear way, with examples so they stick:

---

## üîë 1. Request & Response

* **Request**: What the client (you, browser, Postman, automation script) sends to the server.

  * Includes **method** (GET, POST, etc.), **URL/endpoint**, **headers**, and **body** (if needed).
* **Response**: What the server sends back.

  * Includes **status code**, **headers**, and **body** (data).

**Example**

* Request:

  ```
  GET https://api.example.com/users/123
  ```
* Response:

  ```json
  {
    "id": 123,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  }
  ```

---

## üîë 2. Endpoints

* An **endpoint** is a specific URL where an API can be accessed.
* Think of it like an ‚Äúaddress‚Äù to reach a resource.

**Example**

* `https://api.example.com/users` ‚Üí endpoint to manage users.
* `https://api.example.com/orders` ‚Üí endpoint to manage orders.

---

## üîë 3. Resources

* A **resource** is the data object you‚Äôre interacting with (usually nouns: users, products, orders).
* REST APIs treat resources like **entities** that you can manipulate with HTTP methods.

**Example**

* Resource: `user`
* Endpoint: `/users`
* A specific user resource: `/users/123`

---

## üîë 4. Methods (CRUD Operations)

HTTP methods define **what action** you want to perform on a resource.
They often map to **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

* **GET** ‚Üí Retrieve data.
  Example:

  ```
  GET /users/123
  ```

  ‚Üí fetches user with id 123.

* **POST** ‚Üí Create new data.
  Example:

  ```
  POST /users
  Body: { "name": "John", "email": "john@example.com" }
  ```

  ‚Üí creates a new user.

* **PUT** ‚Üí Update **entire resource** (replace).
  Example:

  ```
  PUT /users/123
  Body: { "name": "John Smith", "email": "john.smith@example.com" }
  ```

  ‚Üí replaces user 123 with new details.

* **PATCH** ‚Üí Update **partial resource** (modify).
  Example:

  ```
  PATCH /users/123
  Body: { "email": "john.new@example.com" }
  ```

  ‚Üí only updates the email.

* **DELETE** ‚Üí Remove resource.
  Example:

  ```
  DELETE /users/123
  ```

  ‚Üí deletes user 123.

---

### üìù Putting it all together:

* **Resource** = `users`
* **Endpoint** = `https://api.example.com/users`
* **Request/Response** = communication between client & server
* **Methods** = actions you can take (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)

---

**Idempotent** means that making the same API call multiple times leaves the system in the same state as making it once.
In HTTP: GET, PUT, DELETE are idempotent. POST is not. PATCH can be idempotent depending on implementation.

* HTTP basics: Headers, Status Codes, Query Params, Path Params, Body, Authentication.
* JSON vs XML payloads.
* Tools: Postman (manual testing), curl (CLI).

**Questions to Ask Yourself**

* What‚Äôs the difference between REST and SOAP APIs?
* How do I test a GET vs POST request?
* What happens if I don‚Äôt provide required headers or parameters?
* How do I validate response codes and payloads?
